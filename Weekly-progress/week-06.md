# CKB Builder Notes – Week 6

##  Overview
This repository contains my **Week 6 learning notes** for Nervos CKB development using the **Rust and Java SDKs**.  
The focus this week was on understanding how to interact with the CKB blockchain programmatically and setting up development environments for different programming languages.

##  Week 6 Learning Report

###  Rust SDK
- Set up the Rust environment for CKB development.
- Learned to create and manage **cells** and **transactions** using Rust.
- Interacted with the CKB network via **RPC calls**.
- Practiced using Rust libraries to handle blockchain data structures.

###  Java SDK
- Configured Java environment for CKB development.
- Built simple Java applications connecting to CKB.
- Sent transactions and queried blockchain data programmatically.
- Gained understanding of blockchain interaction using Java methods.

##  Key Outcomes
- Familiarity with **Rust and Java SDKs** for CKB.
- Ability to **programmatically create and manage cells and transactions**.
- Understanding of **cross-language dApp development** approaches.

---

##  Next Learning Goals
- Build a small dApp using Rust or Java SDK.
- Explore more **advanced SDK features** like scripts and type validation.
- Integrate SDK with frontend applications for full-stack development.
